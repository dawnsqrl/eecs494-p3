[1] Mushroom and snail involve an unbalanced level of decision-making during gameplay (snail has too little special abilities)
-	Added slime trail for snail, which could prevent mycelium expansion and trap mobile mushroom units that walk onto it.
-	Snail now travels faster on existing slime trail.
-	Snail is now able to consume mycelium, which blocks its movement.

[2] Building buttons are inconsistent with most other UI elements in art style and not visually responsive
-	Simplified texture and unified surface material for building buttons.
-	Added attribute tags that appear when hovering mouse over buttons.
-	Mouse cursor texture is now replaced with the corresponding texture when dragging a building onto the map.

[3] Tutorial is purely textual and uninformative for new players
-	Removed all textual description about the game and control schemes.
-	Designed new in-game interactive tutorial sequences for both mushroom and snail that introduce features in a step-by-step fashion.

[4] Appearances of map elements and players are primitive, strange and inconsistent
-	Recreated a large number of sprites in a consistent hand-drawn cartoon style.
-	Added animation for character movement, taking damage, mycelium growth and grass patch entry / exit.

[5] Theming of the game is unclear and does not make any sense based on actual gameplay
-	Titled the game "BIOLOGY 452: Field Ecology of Snail-Fungus Interaction".
-	Consolidated theme context for through game title and sprite design: the competition of mushroom and snail is controlled and observed by a course student, which can be known from notebook pages that appear in-game.

[6] Many incomplete features do not directly contribute to gameplay, sometimes even complicating it
-	Removed fog.
-	Each "soldier factory" is now associated with only one mobile unit to simplify navigation and balance (reduce) mushroom strengths.
-	Removed spawning of mobile snail units.

[7] Map environment is barren and uninteresting
-	Added grass patches that can be hiding spots for the snail.
-	Added rocky boundary to prevent wandering off the map.
-	Added transparent grid outline to ground tiles to assist with building placement.

[8] Game ends too quickly and cheat-like strategies exist
-	Removed unlimited spawning of mobile mushroom units. They can now only be spawned with "soldier factory" building.
-	Cooldown time of mushroom buildings is now dynamically normalized based on current vitality value.
-	Adjusted health of mushroom and snail.
-	Adjusted snail's movement speed.
