The game is in its 6th week of development by a team of 4. In the past week we focused on gameplay balancing (A) and bugfixes (B).

[A1] Added cooldown for Snail's sprint and spit. Spamming these skills had been observed to completely ruin Mushroom's gameplay experience and make it virtually impossible to win.
[A2] Snail now has an upper limit for health and mycelium eating speed. This prevents snail from playing passively-defensively and continuously stack its health and speed attributes through leveling up.
[A3] Snail's natural health regeneration (while not in a grass bush) has been removed. It can now only regain health when staying in grass bushes.
[A4] There are now less grass bushes and they have become more scattered. This adds more challenge to Snail's maneuvering as they look for a place to regenerate health.
[A5] Mushroom's minimap now always shows the entire map. This is to balance the immobility of Mushroom and make it easier for it to expand or defend effectively.
[A6] Snail can now see its current level next to the experience bar.
[A7] Nests can now contain a random number of little mushrooms between 1 and 3 (used to be always 1), and they replenish slightly faster than before. This makes it easier for Snail to recover lost units.

[B1] Mushroom's growth source can now no longer be placed on mucus tiles. Since mucus prevents mycelium growth, this source would become practically useless otherwise.
[B2] Fixed several internal synchronization bugs in the tutorial scene that makes it impossible to (1) access pause menu in the beginning and (2) guide little mushroom attacks with right click.
[B3] Bombs can now properly deal damage to little mushrooms.
[B4] Fixed a bug in tile coverage detection that prevents growth source placement anywhere on the map.
[B5] Optimized performance by reducing animator and alpha updates on mycelium and mucus tiles.

In addition, a new game result scene has been added. The screen displays, in addition to the winning side and total play time, a variety of detailed statistics about the previous match. This includes (and is not limited to) the number of {little snails / little mushrooms / mycelium tiles / mucus tiles / buildings} that are {generated / destroyed}.

In the coming week, this game will be presented during an open playtesting session where we receive live feedback from participating audiences.
