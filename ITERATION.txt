The game is in its 6th week of development by a team of 4. In the past week we focused on gameplay balancing (A) and bugfixes (B).

[A1] Added cooldown for Snail's sprint and spit. Spamming these skills had been observed to completely ruin Mushroom's gameplay experience and make it virtually impossible to win.
[A2] Snail now has an upper limit for health and mycelium eating speed. This prevents snail from playing passively-defensively and continuously stack its health and speed attributes through leveling up.
[A3] There are now less grass bushes and they have become more scattered. This adds more challenge to Snail's maneuvering when they are looking for a place to regenerate health.
[A4] Snail's natural health regeneration (while not in a grass bush) has been removed. It can now only regain health when hiding in grass bushes.
[A5] Mushroom's minimap now covers the entire map range. This is to balance the immobility of Mushroom and enables it to make more informed expansion decisions.

[B1] Mushroom's growth source can now no longer be placed on mucus tiles. Since mucus prevents mycelium growth, this source would become practically useless if we don't prevent this.
[B2] Fixed some internal synchronization bugs in the tutorial scene that (1) makes pausing unresponsive at the beginning and (2) makes it impossible to guide little mushrooms with right click.

In addition, a new game result screen has been added that displays, in addition to the winning side and total play time, a variety of statistics about the match. This includes (but is not limited to) the number of {little snails / little mushrooms / mycelium tiles / mucus tiles / buildings} that are {generated / destroyed}.

In the coming week, this game will be presented during an open playtesting session where we receive live feedback from participating audiences.
