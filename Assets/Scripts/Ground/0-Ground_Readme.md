1. If you need a larger map during gold_spike, please DO NOT copy & paste game objects! Contact Yanmei.
2. Please use parent_30x30 prefabs. 
3. Each grid has a Vector2 as coordinates. Access them in Tile.cs.
4. Access Tile collections (a <Vector2, gameObject> dictionary) in GridManager.cs.
5. Additional functionalities can be added in GroundTileManager.cs or other scripts when needed. Feel free to modify grid prefabs, or add variants.
